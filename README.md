# Pandas_Matplotlib_Iris_Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the **Iris dataset** using **Python**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**. The objective is to explore, analyze, and visualize the data to identify patterns and insights about the three Iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Data Loading & Exploration (Task 1)**
   - Loaded the Iris dataset into a pandas DataFrame
   - Checked data structure and missing values
   - Added a readable `species` column

2. **Basic Data Analysis (Task 2)**
   - Computed descriptive statistics
   - Grouped data by species to compute averages
   - Observed patterns and differences between species

3. **Data Visualization (Task 3)**
   - Line chart of sepal length trends
   - Bar chart of average petal length per species
   - Histogram of sepal width distribution
   - Scatter plot of sepal length vs petal length, colored by species
   - Summarized insights from visualizations

## Key Insights
- Petal dimensions are the most distinctive features separating species.
- Setosa has the smallest petals, Virginica has the largest, and Versicolor is in between.
- Sepal measurements vary less but still provide some separation.

## How to Run
